EXC_1.1
A discrete Signal is given . x(n)={1   <starting point>    ,1,-1,-1} 
A) Find the Frequency Spectrum of signal x(n) for N=4 -> (a) Use the definition of DFT and draw the corresponding schema.
(b) Use Matlab , Octave or Python.

B)Find the Frequency Spectrum of x(n) for N=8 , using 8-point DIT FFT.
C) Assume that x(n) is the input signal of an LTI ( Linear Time-Invariant) System that has an impulse response 
h(n)={1,-1,1}.   Find the output y(n) (a) in time-domain and (b) frequency-domain (DFT & IDFT)
For EXC (C_b) you can use Matlab,Octave or Python.


EXC_1.2
Given a continuous time signal x(t)=cos(Ω1*t)+cos(Ω2*t) , where F1=100Hz and F2=125Hz is being sampled with Frequency Fs=1000Hz. Assume that we have 200 samples (L=200) of the discrete signal after the sampling process.
A.)Design the first 100 samples of signal x(n).
B.)Find the Frequency Spectrum of x(n) for N=200 (DFT for 200 points) .
C.) Do the same as question B , but ths time for N=100.

EXC_1.3
For every button in a 4x4 keyboard corresponds to a Dual-Tone (Dual-Tone Multi-Frequency / DTMF). In the file "DTMF_keypad" is every correspondance of every button. While entering a 4 digit PIN , we captured all the signals that are placed in the file "Recorded_PIN". The sampling Frequency is 8KHz. Find the PIN that was entered.

Design the signals , their amplitude and their amplitude in db.

For better visualization design them for 150 samples ( from sample 501 till sample 650).Use Matlab/Octave/Python.

EXC_1.4
There are some images located in the folder "ASKHSEIS1.3 &1.4". Find their spectrum . After that set every coefficient that is inside the square with sides equal to pi/2 and with center (0,0) to zero and redesign the images that are given.
